The Global Differential GPS System â€“ NASA

FUNCTIONAL OVERVIEW
The GDGPS System is driven by a powerful software set, developed completely in-house at JPL, and possessing 
many unique features and capabilities. The C++ software was developed and evolved from one of the world's 
leading GPS data processing and analysis software packages, JPL's GIPSY-OASIS and its real-time version RTG (
Real Time GIPSY).
